# repository-management Specification

## Purpose

Define the requirements for managing GitHub repositories as code using Terraform. This spec covers
YAML-based configuration, configuration groups with inheritance, repository resource management, team and
collaborator access, rulesets for branch protection, and subscription tier awareness.
## Requirements
### Requirement: YAML-Based Repository Configuration

The system SHALL read repository configurations from YAML files in the `config/` directory using
Terraform's native `yamldecode()` function.

Split configuration applies to: `repository`, `group`, and `ruleset` types only. These MUST be defined
in directories using singular naming convention: `config/repository/`, `config/group/`, `config/ruleset/`.

Organization-level settings (`config/config.yml`) remain a single file and do not support splitting.

#### Scenario: Load common configuration

- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** the system reads `config/config.yml` as a single file
- **AND** parses organization name and subscription tier

#### Scenario: Load repository configuration from directory

- **GIVEN** a `config/repository/` directory exists with files `frontend.yml` and `backend.yml`
- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** the system reads all `.yml` files from the `config/repository/` directory
- **AND** merges them alphabetically into a single configuration map

#### Scenario: Invalid YAML syntax

- **WHEN** a configuration file contains invalid YAML syntax
- **THEN** Terraform fails with a parsing error message indicating the file and location

#### Scenario: Load group configuration from directory

- **GIVEN** a `config/group/` directory exists with files `oss.yml` and `internal.yml`
- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** the system reads all `.yml` files from the `config/group/` directory
- **AND** merges them alphabetically into a single groups configuration map

#### Scenario: Load ruleset configuration from directory

- **GIVEN** a `config/ruleset/` directory exists with files `branch-protection.yml` and `tag-rules.yml`
- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** the system reads all `.yml` files from the `config/ruleset/` directory
- **AND** merges them alphabetically into a single rulesets configuration map

#### Scenario: Empty directory fallback

- **GIVEN** a `config/repository/` directory exists but contains no `.yml` files
- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** the system uses an empty configuration map for repositories

#### Scenario: Duplicate keys across files in directory

- **GIVEN** a `config/repository/` directory contains `frontend.yml` with key `my-repo`
- **AND** `backend.yml` also contains key `my-repo`
- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** the later file (alphabetically, `frontend.yml`) overrides the earlier one (`backend.yml`)

#### Scenario: Missing directory

- **GIVEN** a `config/repository/` directory does not exist
- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** Terraform fails with an error indicating the required directory is missing

#### Scenario: Single file not supported for splittable types

- **GIVEN** only `config/repositories.yml` file exists (no `config/repository/` directory)
- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** Terraform fails with an error indicating directory structure is required

### Requirement: Configuration Groups

The system SHALL support named configuration groups that define shared repository settings.

#### Scenario: Single group inheritance

- **WHEN** a repository specifies `groups: ["oss"]`
- **THEN** all settings from the `oss` group are applied to the repository

#### Scenario: Multiple group inheritance

- **WHEN** a repository specifies `groups: ["base", "oss"]`
- **THEN** settings from `base` are applied first
- **AND** settings from `oss` override conflicting values from `base`

#### Scenario: Repository-level overrides

- **WHEN** a repository specifies both a group and an explicit setting (e.g., `has_wiki: true`)
- **THEN** the explicit setting overrides the group setting

---

### Requirement: Configuration Merging Strategy

The system SHALL merge configurations from groups and repositories using the following strategy:

- Single values (strings, booleans, numbers): later values override earlier ones
- Lists (topics, rulesets): merged and deduplicated
- Maps (teams, collaborators): merged with later values overriding earlier ones

#### Scenario: Topic merging

- **GIVEN** group `oss` defines `topics: ["open-source"]`
- **AND** repository defines `topics: ["terraform"]`
- **WHEN** the configuration is merged
- **THEN** the repository has topics `["open-source", "terraform"]`

#### Scenario: Team merging

- **GIVEN** group `base` defines `teams: {devops: admin}`
- **AND** repository defines `teams: {developers: push}`
- **WHEN** the configuration is merged
- **THEN** the repository has teams `{devops: admin, developers: push}`

---

### Requirement: Repository Resource Management

The system SHALL create and manage GitHub repositories using the Terraform GitHub provider.

#### Scenario: Create new repository

- **WHEN** a repository is defined in `repositories.yml` that does not exist in GitHub
- **AND** `terraform apply` is executed

#### Scenario: Update existing repository

- **WHEN** a repository setting is changed in configuration
- **AND** `terraform apply` is executed
- **THEN** the repository is updated to match the new configuration

#### Scenario: Repository settings applied

- **WHEN** a repository is created or updated
- **THEN** the following settings are applied: visibility, description, homepage_url, has_wiki,
  has_issues, has_projects, has_discussions, allow_merge_commit, allow_squash_merge,
  allow_rebase_merge, allow_auto_merge, allow_update_branch, delete_branch_on_merge,
  web_commit_signoff_required, vulnerability_alerts, topics, license_template

- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** the system uses an empty webhook definitions map

#### Scenario: Missing webhook directory

- **GIVEN** a `config/webhook/` directory does not exist
- **WHEN** Terraform is initialized and planned
- **THEN** the system uses an empty webhook definitions map
- **AND** no error is raised (webhooks are optional)

______________________________________________________________________

### Requirement: Webhook Configuration

The system SHALL support repository webhook configuration by referencing webhook names defined in
`config/webhook/` or by inline definition. Webhooks can be assigned at the group or repository level.

#### Scenario: Reference webhook by name in repository

- **GIVEN** a webhook `jenkins-ci` is defined in `config/webhook/ci.yml`
- **AND** a repository references webhooks in `config/repository/my-repo.yml`:
  ```yaml
  my-repo:
    webhooks:
      - jenkins-ci
  ```
- **WHEN** `terraform apply` is executed
- **THEN** the `jenkins-ci` webhook is created on the repository

#### Scenario: Inline webhook definition in repository

- **GIVEN** a repository defines an inline webhook in `config/repository/my-repo.yml`:
  ```yaml
  my-repo:
    webhooks:
      - name: custom-webhook
        url: https://custom.example.com/webhook
        events: [push]
  ```
- **WHEN** `terraform apply` is executed
- **THEN** the webhook is created on the repository with the specified URL and events

#### Scenario: Webhook with all options

- **GIVEN** a webhook is defined with all configuration options:
  ```yaml
  webhooks:
    - name: full-webhook
      url: https://example.com/hook
      content_type: json
      secret: env:WEBHOOK_SECRET
      events: [push, pull_request, release]
      active: true
      insecure_ssl: false
  ```
- **WHEN** `terraform apply` is executed
- **THEN** the webhook is created with content type `application/json`
- **AND** the secret is read from the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable
- **AND** the webhook triggers on push, pull_request, and release events
- **AND** the webhook is active
- **AND** SSL verification is enabled

#### Scenario: Webhook default values

  ```yaml
  webhooks:
    - name: minimal-webhook
      url: https://example.com/hook
      events: [push]
  ```
- **WHEN** `terraform apply` is executed
